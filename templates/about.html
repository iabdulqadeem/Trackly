                    Trackly was born out of a simple realization: most task managers are built for casual users, but professionals need **accountability**.

                    I'm <strong>Qadeem Arif</strong>, the developer behind Trackly. I built this platform to solve the "reporting gap"—the difficult process of proving your monthly productivity to directors and stakeholders.
